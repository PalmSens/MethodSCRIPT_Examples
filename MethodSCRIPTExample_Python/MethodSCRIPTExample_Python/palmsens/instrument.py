PalmSens instrument module

This module implements the communication protocol. This consists of the
high-level read and write methods, methods to read the firmware version,
identify the device type, execute scripts on the device, etc.

The low-level (physical) communication interface,  is implemented in another
module, so that multiple physical interfaces (e.g. serial port, USB, etc.)
can be supported.

MethodSCRIPT specific methods, such as parsing and interpreting the measurement
data, is implemented in the mscript module.

    This exception could be avoided by increasing the timeout on the low-level
    (serial) interface. However, that could cause the application to block and
    become unresponsive. It's better to keep the low-level read timeouts low

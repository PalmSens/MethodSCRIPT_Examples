PalmSens MethodSCRIPT example: simple Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) measurement

This example showcases how to run a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) measurement on
a MethodSCRIPT capable PalmSens instrument, such as the EmStat Pico.

The following features are demonstrated in this example:
  - Connecting to the PalmSens instrument using the serial port.
  - Running a Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) measurement.
  - Receiving and interpreting the measurement data from the device.
  - Plotting the measurement data.
